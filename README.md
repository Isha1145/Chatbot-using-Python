# Chatbot-using-Python
This project is a basic chatbot implementation built with Python and TensorFlow. It uses a neural network model to classify user inputs into predefined intents and generate appropriate responses. The chatbot is trained on a custom dataset defined in the intents.json file, which contains example patterns (inputs) and responses for each intent.
